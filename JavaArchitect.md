Becoming a Java Architect is a major career milestone that combines deep technical expertise, design skills, and strategic thinking. Here's a roadmap of what you need to learn, with clear topics and phases.
üéØ What Is a Java Architect?

A Java Architect designs and oversees the overall structure of Java applications or systems. This includes:

    Making technology decisions (e.g., Spring Boot vs Jakarta EE)

    Defining architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven)

    Enforcing security, performance, and scalability

    Mentoring developers and reviewing code/designs

üß≠ Roadmap to Become a Java Architect
‚úÖ 1. Master Java Core + Ecosystem
Must-Know:

    Java 8 to 21 features (Streams, Lambdas, Records, Sealed Classes)

    Generics, Collections, Concurrency, Memory model

    JVM internals (GC, classloading, performance tuning)

Tools:

    VisualVM, JFR, JConsole, GC logs, JMH

‚úÖ 2. Backend Frameworks

You must master Spring Boot, as it's industry standard.
Spring Boot Topics:

    Dependency Injection (DI), AOP

    REST APIs, WebFlux (reactive)

    Spring Security, OAuth2, JWT

    Spring Data (JPA, Mongo, Redis)

    Spring Cloud (for microservices)

‚úÖ 3. Databases & Storage

    Relational: PostgreSQL, MySQL (JDBC, JPA, Query optimization)

    NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

    Search: Elasticsearch (for full-text search)

    Caching: Redis, caffeine

‚úÖ 4. Architecture Design Patterns

Know when and how to apply these:
Structural:

    MVC, Layered Architecture

    Microservices, Hexagonal, Clean Architecture

Integration:

    Service Mesh, API Gateway

    Event-driven (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

    CQRS, Saga, Outbox Pattern

Deployment:

    Monolith vs Microservices vs Modular Monolith

    Kubernetes-native microservices

‚úÖ 5. System Design (High-Level Design)

Learn to design systems like:

    Payment gateway

    Social network feed

    File upload system

    Distributed cache

Topics:

    Scalability, latency, throughput

    Load balancing, CAP theorem

    Caching strategies, Idempotency

    Database partitioning, sharding

‚úÖ 6. Security

Every architect must understand:

    Authentication: OAuth2, OIDC, SSO

    Authorization: RBAC, ABAC

    Data encryption at rest/in transit

    Secure APIs: rate-limiting, input validation

    Spring Security internals

‚úÖ 7. Cloud & DevOps

You must know how to design for the cloud:

    Cloud: AWS, Azure, or GCP

        EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, IAM, Lambda, API Gateway

    Docker, Kubernetes (K8s)

    CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD

    Infra as Code: Terraform

‚úÖ 8. Monitoring & Observability

    Logging: ELK, EFK, OpenTelemetry

    Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana

    Tracing: Jaeger, Zipkin

    Alerting and SLO/SLA

‚úÖ 9. Soft Skills & Leadership

    Code reviews, mentorship

    Communicating trade-offs (tech vs business)

    Writing architecture decision records (ADRs)

    Stakeholder communication (devs, PMs, QA, execs)

üõ†Ô∏è Tools You Should Know

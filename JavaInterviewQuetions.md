### Java’s CompletableFuture Writing Non-Blocking Code Made Easy! 💡

Writing asynchronous and non-blocking code is not just an optimization — it’s a requirement.  

💡 What is CompletableFuture?  

CompletableFuture is part of Java’s java.util.concurrent package and helps you:  

✅ Run tasks asynchronously   
✅ Chain multiple tasks without blocking  
✅ Combine multiple futures  
✅ Handle errors gracefully  

🧪 Real-World Example – Calling Two APIs in Parallel  

Imagine a backend service that needs to fetch user profile data and transaction history from two different services:  
```
CompletableFuture<User> userFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> userService.getUser(userId));
CompletableFuture<List<Txn>> txnFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> txnService.getTransactions(userId));

CompletableFuture<CombinedResponse> result = userFuture.thenCombine(txnFuture, (user, txns) ->
 new CombinedResponse(user, txns)
);

result.thenAccept(response -> {
 System.out.println("Final response: " + response);
});
```

🧵 Both tasks run in parallel, improving performance without blocking any thread.  

📌 Commonly used CompletableFuture methods:  

supplyAsync() – Run a task asynchronously and return a value  
runAsync() – Run a task asynchronously that returns no result  
thenApply() – Transform the result when it’s ready  
thenAccept() – Consume the result (no return)  
thenRun() – Run a task after another completes (no access to result)  
thenCombine() – Combine results of two independent futures  
thenCompose() – Chain futures where the second depends on the first  
exceptionally() – Handle exceptions with a fallback  
handle() – Process result or exception in one place  
allOf() / anyOf() – Wait for all or any of multiple futures  

```
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    if (true) throw new RuntimeException("Fail");
    return "OK";
}).exceptionally(ex -> "Recovered: " + ex.getMessage())
  .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```
